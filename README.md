# Machine Learning & Data Science Project

Welcome to the repository for my Machine Learning and Data Science course project! This repository showcases various techniques and practices I've learned, including data scraping, visualization, transformation, and more.

## Introduction

This project encompasses various aspects of machine learning and data science, including web scraping, data visualization, statistical analysis, and interactive chart creation. The aim is to demonstrate practical skills in handling, visualizing, and interpreting data.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Utilized BeautifulSoup to extract data from websites for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Created and formatted various types of charts and graphs including:
  - Line charts
  - Pie charts
  - Statistical plots
- **Data Transformation**: Transformed and standardized data for better analysis.
- **Interactive Charts**: Developed interactive visualizations using Streamlit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `streamlit`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib seaborn streamlit
```

## Technologies

- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping and data extraction.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static plots and charts.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Streamlit**: For building interactive web applications.
